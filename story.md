# Lonely woman cares for bird.
Auteur: *Niels*

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled deep in the woods, there lived a kind-hearted old woman named Agatha. She spent most of her days tending to her garden and helping her neighbors with their chores.<br />
One day, as she was picking berries in the woods, she stumbled upon a wounded bird. The poor creature had a broken wing and couldn't fly. Agatha took the bird back to her cottage and nursed it back to health.<br />
As days passed, the bird grew stronger, and it started to hop around the cottage, exploring every nook and cranny. Agatha was delighted to have a new friend to keep her company, and she would spend hours talking to the bird.<br />
One morning, Agatha woke up to find that the bird had flown away. She searched everywhere but couldn't find it. She felt sad and lonely without her feathered friend. But she knew that the bird needed to be free.<br />
Days turned into weeks, and Agatha had almost given up hope of seeing the bird again. But one day, as she was tending to her garden, she heard a familiar chirping sound. She looked up and saw the bird perched on a tree branch, watching her.<br />
Agatha smiled and walked over to the bird. She held out her hand, and the bird flew down and landed on her shoulder. It chirped happily, and Agatha knew that it was thanking her for taking care of it.<br />
From that day on, the bird would visit Agatha every now and then, bringing joy to her life. And Agatha knew that even though the bird was free to fly away, it would always come back to her, because true friendship knows no bounds.<br />
